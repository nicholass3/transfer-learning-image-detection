# transfer-learning-image-detection
Image classification models to classify RGB images into 16 labels. The dataset consisted of a training set with labeled images accross 16 labels, and a test set of unlabeled images. The goal of this project was to use different machine learning algorithms to accurately map new test images to the correct class label.
