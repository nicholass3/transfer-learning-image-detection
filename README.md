# transfer-learning-image-detection
Image classification models to classify RGB images into 16 labels. The dataset consisted of a training set with labeled images accross 16 labels, and a test set of unlabeled images. The goal of this project was to use different machine learning algorithms to accurately map new test images to the correct class label.

Multiple classification algorithms were employed for a comprehensive analysis, including training a self-developed convolutional neural network (CNN) and using transfer learning with pretrained models: MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50. The performance of each algorithm was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, precision, recall, f1-score and visual inspection of misclassified examples.
